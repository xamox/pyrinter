This is a simple python/perl script mashup that allows you to print
text to a Brother PT-1230PC through a web browser.

  Basically you visit:
  http://localhost:8080/printtext/hello

  And the Labeler will print hello with a line feed.

Currently only text is supported.  Other models of brother label
printers may work but I have only tested it on the Brother PT-1230PC.
